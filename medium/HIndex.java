/*
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

public class HIndex {
	/*
	 * intuition:
	 * H could be number of papers with at least H citation
	 * binary search?

    public static int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int H=0, l=citations.length;
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        for(int i=l; i>=1; i--) {
        	if(citations[l-i]>=i) {H=i;break;}
        }
        return H;
    }
    
    public static void main(String args[]) {
    	int  []nums= {0,2,0};
    	System.out.println(hIndex(nums));
